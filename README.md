🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction
This project uses the classic Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, sex, passenger class, fare, and more.

📌 Project Overview
Goal: Predict passenger survival using classification.

Dataset: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

🧠 Features Used
Pclass – Ticket class

Sex – Gender

Age – Age in years

SibSp – Number of siblings/spouses aboard

Parch – Number of parents/children aboard

Fare – Passenger fare

Embarked – Port of embarkation

🚀 Workflow
Load and explore the dataset

Handle missing data

Encode categorical variables

Split the data into training and test sets

Train a Random Forest Classifier

Evaluate performance (accuracy, confusion matrix)

Plot feature importance

📈 Model Evaluation
Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

Metrics: Accuracy Score, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix

📊 Sample Visualization
Count of survivors vs non-survivors
